### Course description

This course introduces fundamental and practical tools, techniques, and algorithms for Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KD&DM). It provides a balanced approach between methods and practice. On the methodological side, it covers several techniques for transforming corporate data into business intelligence. These include: online Analytical Processing (OLAP) Systems, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Rule-Based Systems (RBS), Fuzzy Logic (FL), Machine Learning (ML), Classification Trees (C4.5 Algorithm), and Classification and Regression Trees (CART Algorithm). To illustrate the practical significance of the various techniques, half of the course is devoted to case studies. The case studies, drawn from real-world applications, demonstrate application of techniques to real-world problems.
